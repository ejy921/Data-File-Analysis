Test Plan for Homework 2 - mbti-stats.c

This test will include testing of valid and expected inputs, as well as
unexpected values in order to read input from a file, save it into an
array, and perform various analyses and print out a diagram from the
results.

Checklist:
- Opens and reads in file successfully
- reads in each line of the file and saves it into an array
- check if the data is readable and in the correct data type before
converting the string into float
- if the data is not convertible to a float, print and return an error
- writes on a file that is created and prints out the histogram according
to the statistics
- prints out the percentages alongside
- finds the mode, and the index of the mode value
- calculates the mean
- find the index of the mean value
- prints on the file the statistical analyses
- closes file successfully
- program terminates successfully

As mentioned above, it is possible to check for invalid data types that are
not convertible to floats by using the return type of atof.

I also consistently checked for mean and median values during the program
with commented print statements to check while writing the program.

The program completed each task in the checklist successfully.
