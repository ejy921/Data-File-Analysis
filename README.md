# MBTI Data-File-Analysis


The code in mbti-stats.c reads in a file with statistical numbers (input-file.txt) for each MBTI-type population in the US, then outputs a file that contains a bar graph and some statistical analyses on the numbers (output-file.txt).
This is done by working with arrays, and most importantly by reading a data file stream. Data analyses include the mode and the mean.


The mbti-transcript.txt file is a transcript of the command prompt when running the program. In the transcript, there is record of trying multiple test cases.
